DESIGN CHOICES:
The biggest unusual design choice I have is not creating a layer every time a shape is created.
I only create a layer when raising or lowering a shape a "layer". A layer instance is associated with a given shape.
I see layers as a more abstract and temporary representation in my implementation. An implementation of the
layer class where a layer is created for each new shape felt unnatural to me because a shapes layer is hard
to define in the first place since it might have a different index in the shapes list vs the saveables list.
 
I used the suggested interfaces and avoided abstract classes. This design choice led to more repeated code
in my sketchy shapes class but it allows for much easier implementation in my Sketchy class.
